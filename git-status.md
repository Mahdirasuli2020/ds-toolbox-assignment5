# Definition: git status

It displays information about files that have been modified but not yet committed.
we can see which files are staged and which are untracked.
Essentially, it summarizes all changes made since the last commit.

Alternative way to do it from jupyter lab:
In the left sidebar, click on the Git icon (usually represented by a branch or a version control symbol). This will open the Git tab. In the Git tab, you’ll see a summary of your repository’s status.
